# enka.cards

Originally going to have the domain name of "enka.cards" but has now been moved over to "cards.enka.network". Read below on how to use.

With your enka.network profile, have you ever wanted the card to show up in your Discord embed? Well, now you can! Just replace your original enka.network link with cards.enka.network and you're good to go!

Example:
```
https://enka.network/u/jxtq/488BWO/10000089/3018594
```
Replace with:
```
https://cards.enka.network/u/jxtq/488BWO/10000089/3018594
```

This will now show up in your Discord embeds!
