# enka.cards

Originally going to have the domain name of "enka.cards" but has now been moved over to "cards.enka.network". Read below on how to use.

With your enka.network profile, have you ever wanted the card to show up in your Discord embed? Well, now you can! Just replace your original enka.network link with cards.enka.network and you're good to go!

Example:

```
https://enka.network/u/jxtq/488BWO/10000089/3018594
```

Replace with:

```
https://cards.enka.network/u/jxtq/488BWO/10000089/3018594
```

This will now show up in your Discord embeds!

## Extra info

With your traditional link for cards.enka.network, you can malform it to have different outcomes depending on what you want. Here is a list of things you can do:

Append /image onto your link, example https://cards.enka.network/u/jxtq/488BWO/10000089/3018594/image, to grab the image directly, this also doesn't require you to be on the Discord useragent so anyone can load the images, if you want to save the images though I'd recommend just downloading direct from enka.

Appending ?lang= onto the end of the url allows you to choose a language, for example https://cards.enka.network/u/jxtq/488BWO/10000089/3018594?lang=es is the spanish version of the card. This also works with the /image link.
