# enka.cards

Originally going to have the domain name of "enka.cards" but has now been moved over to "cards.enka.network". Read below on how to use.

With your enka.network profile, have you ever wanted the card to show up in your Discord embed? Well, now you can! Just replace your original enka.network link with cards.enka.network and you're good to go!

Example:

```
https://enka.network/u/jxtq/488BWO/10000089/3018594
```

Replace with:

```
https://cards.enka.network/u/jxtq/488BWO/10000089/3018594
```

This will now show up in your Discord embeds!

## Accepted Links

- Standard User Account Profiles. e.g. https://enka.network/u/jxtq/488BWO/10000089/3018594
- Genshin UID Lookup links. e.g. https://enka.network/u/744008962/
- HSR UID Lookup links. e.g. https://enka.network/hsr/616910611/

## How to use

1. Copy the link you want to convert.
2. Replace "enka.network" with "cards.enka.network".
3. Paste the new link into your Discord embed.

## Specifics

- If you are using a Genshin / HSR UID lookup link, you will need to add either the character name, character id or card number at the end of the url. Examples being like: https://enka.network/u/744008962/1, https://enka.network/u/744008962/10000089 or https://enka.network/u/744008962/Furina
- If you are wanting a specific language that enka.network accepts, append `?lang={language}` to the end of the URL. Example: https://cards.enka.network/u/jxtq/488BWO/10000089/3018594?lang=fr
- If wanting just the image (which isn't checked for being Discord or not), append `/image` to the end of the URL, but if you want a seperate language that must go after the `/image` part. Example: https://cards.enka.network/u/jxtq/488BWO/10000089/3018594/image or with a language https://cards.enka.network/u/jxtq/488BWO/10000089/3018594/image?lang=fr

## Notes

- If the link is a 404, you will just get sent to enka.network.
- If you go to the card link, you will get redirected to the card on enka, unless you can not which you will just be redirected to the first card enka picks for you
- If you go to the image link, you will get the image, this is the only link that doesn't redirect if Discord isn't the one fetching the link for the embed.
